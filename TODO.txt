Welcome to my tutorials and reference guide around the creation of apps for the iOS operating system. This website exists to give me, and anyone else who wants to use it, an alternative and easy set of reference guides and tutorials.

Expect this site to be a mess in places however as I'll slowly be building it up as I learn more.


These will be the links shown in the menu bar, similar to the sony page. On clicking home, you'll be shown
the welcome text.

On clicking tutorials; images and text links will appear. Down the side will the main navigation:
	* The Language
	* Core Data
	* 

Home
Tutorials
Reference
Contact


Menu design:
The menu needs to go over the top of the css fade effect.

Make it a three piece one like Sony for now.
	* Add a bar at the top. Total black, but with a red bottom border. 30 pixels tall. 100% width.



Scrap the above. No theft necessary.

You will need a wrapper.
You will then need wrappers for your content.

Also, what are the necessary items in the primary navigation menu?
	* Home
	* Learning
	* Contact
	* About


Create a new page and give it the same dimensions are your resolution.

I want to go with a simple design.

I know how the primary navigation should look now. But what about getting around the rest of the site?

Step 1 is to get a responsive menu up at the top.

If I had a drop down menu it would have:
	* Language
	* Core Data
	* Controls

What you're looking at really is a hierarchical structure:
	one item leads to several others, etc.

How should I lay this out? Do you want it to only be for iOS? That was the original intention. Start with that. In which case, your options should be

Swift
	Feature 1
	Feature 2
Core Data
	Basics
	Subclassing NSManagedObject

Where will the actual information live?
Each node should point to a link, which is fine. Fucking hell it's too hot for this.

You need a way to dynamically load the items.

One model:

	Each item can be a node

class Node {
	this.title = title
	this.
}


In the database:
	Each node will have an id.
	Each node will have a parent id.
	Each node will have text.


Side menu behaviour
	* Double click expands
	* Single click selects
	* You want MVC!



Model:
	MenuNode.js
	MenuNodeCollection.js
